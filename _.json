Electric Arc is a rules-light, streamlined version of D&D, designed by Jonathan Tweet, with a focus on fast play and a more modern setting. It was first released in 2018, building upon the core mechanics of the original Electric Arc game system that was introduced in 2015.\n\nIn Electric Arc 2e, players create characters using a point-buy system, where they allocate points to abilities, skills, and attributes to represent their strengths and weaknesses. The game emphasizes narrative and storytelling, with a strong emphasis on character interaction and exploration. Combat is resolved quickly using a \"Roll for Damage\" mechanic, which encourages players to narrate their actions and the effects of their spells.\n\nThe game\"s setting, called \"The Auroraverse,\" is a science fiction backdrop, incorporating elements of technology, magic, and advanced civilizations. Electric Arc 2e supports a variety of genres, from space opera to cyberpunk, allowing for a wide range of adventures.\n\nOne of the key features of Electric Arc 2e is its \"Quick Start\" system, which makes it easy for new players to jump into a game without a lengthy rules tutorial. The game also includes a focus on character-driven stories, with a strong emphasis on player agency and character development.\n\nOverall, Electric Arc 2e is a simplified and modern take on the D&D experience, providing a streamlined and enjoyable gaming experience for players who value quick and dynamic gameplay without sacrificing depth."
